## About the game
A simple smash bros inspired video game project about the ongoing debate for best library at UF

This project is made using javascript and the Phaser framework

Future goals for the project include implementing a more refined NPC fighter as well as more items and game modes.

Getting Started:

In order to test the game locally, you need to make a local web server, there are python commands, and plug-ins for visual studio code and other IDEs that will let you do this.
