# Marston-VS-West
## In order to test the game, you need to make a local web server, there are python commands, and plug-ins for visual studio code and other IDEs that will let you do this.

A simple smash bros inspired video game project about the ongoing debate for best library at UF

This project is made using javascript and the Phaser framework

Current issues are finishing up arcade mode, and fleshing out character movesets

Future goals for the project include implementing a more refined NPC fighter as well as more items and game modes.


Getting Started:
Visual studio code is a great IDE that will let you work on the game code, push and pull from the repo and best of all it has plug ins to let you make a local live server to test the game out. Brackets is also another option in terms of an IDE that will let you test the game out as well.
